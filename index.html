<p>The <strong>Hyrax Project</strong> is a personal wiki &amp; <a
href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history"
class="external">digital garden</a> for the formal exploration of topics
in and around categorical logic and type theory, with an emphasis on <a
href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+mathematics"
class="external">synthetic mathematics</a>, written by me, <a
href="https://cbaberle.com" class="external">Corinthia Beatrix
Aberlé</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from serving as my own personal repository of knowledge, Hyrax
aims to be an approachable, comprehensive, and explorable resource for
learning the topics it encompasses, in the mould of formalization
projects such as the <a href="https://1lab.dev"
class="external">1Lab</a>. To this end, Hyrax is also a literate <a
href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php"
class="external">Agda</a> library consisting of both formally-verified
code and explanatory prose.</p>
<pre class="Agda"><a id="1882" class="Symbol">{-#</a> <a id="1886" class="Keyword">OPTIONS</a> <a id="1894" class="Pragma">--rewriting</a> <a id="1906" class="Pragma">--cohesion</a> <a id="1917" class="Pragma">--flat-split</a> <a id="1930" class="Symbol">#-}</a>

</pre>
<p>However, Hyrax takes a distinct approach to formalization from many
of its sister projects, in that it does not aim to use the type
theoretic language of Agda to prove results <em>directly</em>, but
rather uses this language to construct and compare <em>other</em>
theories and languages in which these results may naturally be proved.
In other words, instead of using Agda as a foundational system for
mathematics, Hyrax uses Agda as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework"
class="external">logical framework</a> for the invention and exploration
of such foundational systems themselves.</p>
<p>This kind of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalinguistic_abstraction"
class="external">metalinguistic abstraction</a> serves as a key
principle of the philosophy of <em>synthetic mathematics,</em> for which
Hyrax aims to serve as both exposition and proof-of-concept. For more on
the philosophy of synthetic mathematics that underlies Hyrax, see the
module <a href="404.html">What is Synthetic Mathematics?</a>:</p>
<pre class="Agda"><a id="2945" class="Comment">-- open import library.synthetic-math</a>
</pre>
<p>For more on the axiomatic framework underlying Hyrax, and its
implementation in Agda, take a look at the module <a
href="library/synthetic-agda.html">Introduction to Synthetic
Agda</a>:</p>

</pre>
<p>Finally, to get started exploring Hyrax, head on over to the <a
href="library/contents.html">table of contents</a>:</p>

<h2 id="related">Related Projects</h2>
<p>Although Hyrax aims to be relatively self-contained, ultimately it
exists as part of a much larger network of online references and
formalization projects in category theory and type theory, several of
which directly inspired the conception of Hyrax:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://1lab.dev" class="external">1Lab</a> – an
experiment in discoverable formalisation of univalent mathematics in
Cubical Agda.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://clowderproject.com" class="external">Clowder
Project</a> – an online reference work and wiki for category theory and
mathematics.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<p><img src="img/profile-picture4.jpg" class="bodyimg framed oval"
style="float:left; margin-right: 1em;" width="180" /></p>
<p>I am a PhD student studying Pure and Applied Logic in the Computer
Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research is focused
on type theory, category theory, categorical logic, and applications
thereof to programming languages and formal verification. For more about
me, see <a href="https://cbaberle.com" class="external">my personal
website</a>.</p>
<p>My path into academia has been unorthodox and at times complex.
Having completed the equivalent of a high-school education by the age of
14, at that time I chose to devote myself to a career in music as a
composer. In the course of pursuing my studies of music, however, I
became increasingly interested in mathematics, logic, and computer
science, and eventually became determined to study these topics at a
research level. However, at that time (around 20 years of age) I had no
qualifications in these areas, nor even a high school diploma, and it
was primarily through access to online resources for learning these
subjects that I was able to get where I am today. As such, I strive to
ensure that my own academic work is freely available and easily
accessible, as my own small way of giving back to the community.</p>
